      <dd>As of now I am a Software Tester with experience in UX testing and a Master degree holder in Power Systems . I used to be a Lecturer before I rediscovered myself into a new career path.
        I also used to be a woman who was trying to figure out what I can do with my life to put all my skills to its best use, Until I took my baby steps into the magical castle of "Hello World!"

        Have you ever wondered how can people even think of code, I can't even read it. It looks gibberish.      
      </li>
      
      <li> Have you ever felt seeing a code..AHH!! It scares me !..Take it away!!
      </li>
      <li>Have you thought of taking a shortcut, every time you see a CODE.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
     
    
    <p>Trust me! I have felt the same too. And this is why I would love to document my journey so you can be sure, 
      if she can do it! I can do it too! I would like to share with you how things changed for me. 
      And if the lessons I learned from my mistakes could mean something to you..It's worth it!
      I am not going to tell you how to be a coding genius as I am not one myself. Nor am I going to upload technical tutorials.
      All I am planning to do is walk you through all the things that you need to know about if you want to pursue a career in testing. And the best places where you can learn all these tools and techniques for free.
      
      Please answer these questions for me.
